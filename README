A cron will need to be set up to get the nyc_weather_dump file
curl https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/2459115/ -o /<directory>/nyc_weather_dump > /dev/null 2>&1

Colors are controlled by the server backend numbers as in example, 5=red, 6=green, 7=yellow
Brightness can be controlled by changing the analog write frequency of the led library on the device
